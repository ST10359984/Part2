# Part2
The original code served as a basic framework for a recipe management console application in C#. Enhancements were made to transform it into a more robust and feature-rich application. The Recipe class was augmented to include properties for Calories and FoodGroup for each ingredient, providing a more comprehensive nutritional profile for recipes. The Ingredient class was updated accordingly to store these new details.

In the Program class, significant changes were implemented to accommodate a dynamic list of recipes, enabling users to add an unlimited number of recipes. New features were introduced, such as displaying all recipes alphabetically, selecting a recipe to view in detail, and calculating the total calories of a recipe. A notification system was also integrated to alert users when the total calorie count of a recipe exceeded a certain threshold.

The user interaction was refined to include options for scaling recipes by different factors and for resetting ingredient quantities to their original values. Additionally, the ability to clear a recipe from the application's memory was added, enhancing the user's control over the data.

Overall, the application was transformed from a simple command-line interface into a more interactive and user-friendly tool, with expanded capabilities for recipe management and nutritional tracking. The code was structured to follow best practices, ensuring readability and maintainability.
